//// Exercise 16.32:
//// What happens during template argument deduction?
////  The process of determining the template arguments from the function arguments
////  is known as template argument deduction. During template argument deduction,
////  the compiler uses types of the arguments in the call to find the template
////  arguments that generate a version of the function that best matches the given
////  call.
